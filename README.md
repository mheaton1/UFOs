# UFOs
### Overview 
###### The purpose of this analysis was to create a webpage that users can easily sort through a large data set to find different UFO sightings. 
### Results 
###### ![filter table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114840416/215290826-c12b0686-8b3a-4893-a208-743499c46ded.PNG)
###### The filter table allows you to enter specific critera to find UFO sightings either in a specific area or a specific shape etc. 
### Summary 
###### I feel as though the table doesnt filter the data completely. You can type a specfic state in but other states will still show. I also feel as though you should be able to enter in just one piece of serch critera. For example, if you just wanted to search for circles.
